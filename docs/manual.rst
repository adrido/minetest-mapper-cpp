Invocation
==========

Basic Usage (Linux / BSD / ...)
-------------------------------

.. NOTE::
	For readability, example commands below are spread over multiple lines, using '``\``' as
	a continuation character: '``\``' as the last character on a line indicates that the command
	continues on the next line. Most shells will also interpret '``\``' in that way, and execute
	the entire command only after the first line that does not end in '``\``'.

	Alternatively, all parts of the command-line can be typed on a single line, without the '``\``'
	characters.


After installation, minetestmapper is started as follows::

    minetestmapper \
	--input <world-directory> \
	--output <image-file-name.png>

If the world is not too large, and if minetestmapper is installed in
a  system directory, it will most likely work as expected.

Possibly, minetestmapper will not be able to find a colors.txt file. If that happens,
the colors.txt file can be specified on the command-line::

    minetestmapper \
	--input <world-directory> \
	--output <image-file-name.png> \
	--colors <filename>

Or copy the colors.txt to a location where minetestmapper will automatically find it.
A colors.txt file (named ``colors.txt``, in lowercase) in the world's directory will certainly
be found.  Depending on the system and the configuration, a number of other locations are
searched as well. Use the following command to find out which::

    minetestmapper \
	--input <world-directory> \
	--output <image-file-name.png> \
	--verbose-search-colors=2

See also: `Colors Files Search Locations`_.

From this basis, add any number of other options that are documented below, according
to to personal needs and taste.

Basic Usage (Windows)
---------------------

.. NOTE::
	For readability, example commands below are spread over multiple lines, using '``^``' as
	a continuation character: '``^``' as the last character on a line indicates that the command
	continues on the next line. The regular windows command prompt will also interpret '``^``'
	as such, and excute the entire command only after the first line that does not end in '``^``'.

	So there are two options:

	* Type the commands exactly as shown, making sure '``^``' is the last character on each line
	  before typing return.

	* Type all parts of the command one after another, omitting the '``^``' characters and
	  type return only after typing the line that does not end in '``^``'.

.. NOTE::
	The following commands assume that minetestmapper is installed in ``c:\games\minetestmapper``, and that
	minetestmapper.exe is in ``c:\games\minetestmapper\bin``. If it installed elsewhere, use the actual
	installation path instead.

From the Command-line
.....................

After installation, minetestmapper is started as follows from the command-line::

    c:\games\minetestmapper\bin\minetestmapper.exe ^
	--input <world-directory> ^
	--output <image-file-name.png>

Possibly, minetestmapper will not be able to find the colors.txt file. If that happens, either
specify its location on the command-line::

    c:\games\minetestmapper\bin\minetestmapper.exe ^
	--input <world-directory> ^
	--output <image-file-name.png> ^
	--colors <filename>

Or copy the colors.txt to a location where minetestmapper will automatically find it.
A colors.txt file (named ``colors.txt``, in lowercase) in the world's directory will certainly
be found.  Depending on the system and the configuration, a number of other locations are
searched as well. Use the following command to find out which::

    c:\games\minetestmapper\bin\minetestmapper ^
	--input <world-directory> ^
	--output <image-file-name.png> ^
	--verbose-search-colors=2

See also: `Colors Files Search Locations`_.

From this basis, add any number of other options that are documented below, according
to personal needs and taste.

Using a Batch File
..................

A batch file is an easy way to prepare a minetestmapper command for later execution. While
batch files have many interesting features, only a simple example is given here.

The basics of batch files can be easily found on internet. Search for '*writing a
batch file*' if the description below is too succint.

Using notepad, create a file ``mapper.bat``, which contains the command-line, exactly like it
would be typed at the prompt. For example::

    c:\games\minetestmapper\bin\minetestmapper ^
	--input c:\games\minetest\worlds\myworld ^
	--output c:\games\minetest\worlds\myworld\map.png ^
	--colors c:\games\colors.txt

save the file (for example as ``c:\users\John\mapper.bat``), and execute it at the command-prompt::

    c:\> c:\users\John\mapper.bat

And the minetestmapper command-line from the batch file will be executed.

Graphical Interface
-------------------

A nice graphical interface is also available for minetestmapper. It can be obtained
from `<https://bitbucket.org/adrido/minetestmappergui>`_. It runs both on Windows and
on Linux.

Mapping while Minetest is Running
---------------------------------

Depending on the backend, it is possible to run minetestmapper while minetest
is also running (and most probably accessing and modifying the database).

+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|Backend	|Support for online mapping					|
+===============+===============================================================+
|SQLite3	|Works perfectly since 30 dec 2015, or minetest version		|
|		|0.4.14 and later.						|
|		|								|
|		|Minetest versions before 30 dec 2015 (or: version 0.4.13 and	|
|		|earlier) probably can't handle concurrent mapping, and		|
|		|may almost certainly crash with error 'database is locked'.	|
|		|(but different systems may still behave differently...)	|
|		|								|
|		|Minetest versions since 30 dec 2015 (or version 0.4.14 and	|
|		|later), may still be affected by locking delays, and even	|
|		|rare crashes. Use `--sqlite3-limit-prescan-query-size`_ if	|
|		|necessary.							|
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|PostgreSQL	|Works perfectly.						|
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|LevelDB	|Not possible. The database can't be accessed by multiple	|
|		|clients concurrently.						|
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|Redis		|Works perfectly. May affect minetest lag ?			|
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

When using an SQLite3 database and a minetest version from before 30 dec 2015,
mapping may be possible while minetest is running, provided no players are online
and there are no forceloaded blocks (i.e. provided minetest is not accessing the
database while minetestmapper is running). The older versions of minetest will
only crash if they find the database temporarily locked when writing (due to
minetestmapper accessing it). Try at your own risk.

Newer versions of may be affected by delays (i.e. lag). If the database is very large,
and the prescan query keeps it locked for too long a time, minetest may still bail out.

Detailed Description of Options
-------------------------------

	A number of options have shorthand equivalent options. For instance
	``--help`` and ``-h`` are synonyms. The following are notable:

	* ``-h`` = ``--help``
	* ``-V`` = ``--version``
	* ``-o`` = ``--output``
	* ``-i`` = ``--input``

	For the others, please consult the source code. Note that support
	for other short options than mentioned above might be removed in
	the future.

	**Available options**:

.. Contents:: :local:


``--backend auto|sqlite3|postgresql|leveldb|redis``
...................................................
	Set or override the database backend to use.

	By default (``auto``), the database is obtained from the world configuration,
	and there is no need to set it,

	For backward compatibility, besides supporting the official implementation,
	minetestmapper still supports two previous unofficial implementations of
	postgresql support for minetest. These are ShadowNinja's, and johnnyjoy's.
	Support for these two versions will be removed in a future version of
	minetestmapper.

``--bgcolor <color>``
.....................
	Specify the background color for the image. See `Color Syntax`_ below.

	Two maps with different background:

	.. image:: images/background-white.png
	.. image:: images/background-blueish.png

``--blockcolor <color>``
........................
	Specify the color for empty mapblocks. See `Color Syntax`_ below.

	An empty mapblock exists in the database, but contains only *air* or *ignore*
	nodes. It is normally not visible, even if no other mapblocks exist above
	or below it. This color makes such blocks visible if no nodes other than
	air or ignore are above or below it.

	To see the difference between empty blocks and absent blocks, generate a map
	that is larger than the world size by at least 2 map blocks.

	Two maps, the second with blockcolor enabled:

	.. image:: images/background-white.png
	.. image:: images/blockcolor-yellowish.png


``--centergeometry <geometry>``
...............................
	Suggest interpreting a geometry as center coordinates and dimensions. If possible.

	See also `--geometry`_

``--chunksize <size>``
......................
	Set or override the chunk size.

	The chunk size is the unit of map generation in minetest. Minetest never generates
	a single block at a time, it always generates a chunk at a time.

	The chunk size may be used by the `--tiles`_ option. It is obtained from
	the world by default. It is usually, but not necessarily, 5 (i.e. 5x5x5 blocks).

``--colors <file>``
...................
	Specify the location and name of the 'colors.txt' file to use.

	See `Colors and Nodes Files`_ and `Colors.txt Syntax`_.

	By default, minetestmapper will attempt to automatically find a suitable
	colors.txt file. See `Colors Files Search Locations`_.

``--cornergeometry <geometry>``
...............................
	Suggest interpreting a geometry as corner coordinates and dimensions. If
	possible.

	See also `--geometry`_

``--database-format minetest-i64|freeminer-axyz|mixed|query``
..................................................................
	Specify the coordinate format minetest uses in the LevelDB database.

	This option is only needed, and has only effect, when
	`--disable-blocklist-prefetch`_ is used, *and* when the database backend
	is 'leveldb'. Users of other backends can ignore this option.

	**Background**

	A freeminer LevelDB database has two possible coordinate formats. Normally,
	minetestmapper detects which one is used for which block when prefetching
	a block coordinate list.  With ``--disable-blocklist-prefetch``, minetestmapper
	will not start by reading a list of all blocks in the database. It therefore
	won't be able to detect what format is actually used for the coordinates of
	every block (which might differ per block).

	Without knowing the format used for a block, the only way to be sure that it
	is not in the database, is to use two queries, one for each format. Specifying
	the format allows minetestmapper to avoid the second query, with the risk of
	overseeing blocks if they do happen to use the other format.

	**Values**

	:``mixed``:	(default) This works in all cases, as both queries are
			performed if needed (at the very least for all blocks that are
			not in the database), but it is less efficient.

			Use this on older freeminer worlds, and on worlds that were
			migrated from minetest (if such worlds exist ?).

	:``minetest-i64``:
			The ``i64`` format used by minetest. Specify this for minetest
			worlds, as it is, and has always been, the only format used.

	:``freeminer-axyz``:
			The ``axyz`` format used by freeminer since april 2014. Specify
			this for freeminer worlds that are known not to contain ``i64``
			blocks. This includes all worlds created by a freeminer version
			that dates from after april 2014.

	:``query``:	Directs minetestmapper to detect and report the coordinate
			format(s) used in the database. This requires that full block list
			be fetched from the database, so ``--disable-blocklist-prefetch``
			must be not be set, and ``--prescan-world`` must not be ``disabled``.

			Once the actual coordinate format(s) are known, the most appropriate
			value can be selected.


	Specifying ``minetest-i64`` or ``freeminer-axyz`` incorrectly results in all
	blocks that use the other format not being mapped.

``--disable-blocklist-prefetch``
......................................
	Do not prefetch a list of block coordinates from the database before commencing
	map generation.

	This is synonymous with `--prescan-world=disabled`_.

	This option will probably improve mapping speed when mapping a smaller part
	of a very large world. In other cases it may actually reduce mapping speed.
	It is incompatible with, and  disables, the 'shrinking' mode of `--geometrymode`_.
	It also significantly reduces the amount of information the `--verbose`_ option
	can report.

	When used with a LevelDB backend, the option `--database-format`_ should preferably
	be used as well.

	**Background**

	Normally, minetestmapper will read a full list of coordinates (not the contents)
	of existing blocks from the database before starting map generation. This option
	disables such a query, and instead, causes and all blocks that are in the mapped
	space to be requested individually, whether or not they are in the database.

	Querying the database for a block coordinate list beforehand is time-consuming
	on large databases. If just a small part of a large world is being mapped, the
	time for this step quickly dominates the map generation time.

	On the other hand, querying the database for large numbers of non-existing blocks
	while mapping (possibly several orders of magniture more than there are existing
	blocks!) is also quite inefficient. If a large part of the blocks queried are not
	in the database, the cost of those extra queries will quickly dominate map generation
	time.

	The tradeoff between those two approaches depends on the volume being mapped, the
	speed of the disk (or SSD), the database backend being used, the number of blocks
	in the database, etc.

	The worst-case behavior of this option is probably quite bad, even though it will
	refuse to continue if the requested space is excessive: exceeding 1G (2^30) blocks.
	Please use this option with consideration, and use `--progress`_ to monitor its
	actual behavior.

``--draw[map]<figure> "<geometry> <color> [<text>]"``
.....................................................
	Draw a figure on the map, with the given geometry and color.

	Possible figures are:

	* circle
	* ellipse (which is a synonym for circle)
	* line
	* arrow
	* point (which uses simple coordinates (x,y) instead of a geometry)
	* rectangle
	* text (which uses simple coordinates (x,y) instead of a geometry)

	If ``--draw<figure>`` is used, the geometry specifies world coordinates;
	if ``--drawmap<figure>`` is used, the geometry specifies map (i.e. image)
	coordinates, where 0,0 is the top-left corner of the map-part of
	the image, and coordinates increase to the right and down. Any points
	in the left and top scale area (if present) have negative coordinates.

	Note that the combination of geometry and color (and text if applicable)
	must be a single argument.  This means that they *must* be enclosed
	in quotes together on the command-line, else they will be misinterpreted
	as two or more command-line arguments.

	Example::

		minetestmapper --drawcircle "10,10:6x6 red"

	For the color of figures, an alpha value can be specified. Note that
	due to a bug in the drawing library, this has not the expected effect
	when drawing circles and ellipses.

	See also `Geometry Syntax`_ and `Color Syntax`_.

	**Interaction of figure geometry and map scaling**

	If the map is scaled, figures could either keep the same size in pixels,
	or the same size relative to the world, which would make them appear
	smaller like the entire map. Whether they scale of not depends on how
	they are drawn:

	 * Figures which are drawn using map (i.e. image) coordinates are never scaled.
	   It is assumed that it was the intention to draw them on the image to
	   begin with, and not in the world.

	At the moment, figures which are drawn using world coordinates may or
	may not scale with the world.

	*  If the geometry of a figure is specified using 2 corners, then the distance
	   between the coordinates obviously scales with the world, and the resulting
	   figure will be visually smaller as well.

	*  If the geometry of a figure is specified using a corner or the center
	   and dimensions, then the corner or center is obviously also interpreted
	   as world-coordinates, but the dimensions will be interpreted relative
	   to the image. I.e. they won't scale with the map.

	*  If the geometry is specified using an angle and length, and if the
	   length is specified in nodes (e.g. '20n'), the size will scale. If
	   the length is specified in pixels (e.g. '20p') or if no unit is
	   specified, then the size will not scale.

	In practise this means that two identically-sized figures in a full-scale
	map, may have different sizes after scaling, depending on how their
	geometry was specified. The jury is still out as to whether this is
	a bug or a feature.

``--draw[map]circle "<geometry> <color>"``
..........................................
	Draw a circle on the map, with the given geometry and color.

	If the geometry does not specify equal horizontal and vertical
	dimensions, then an ellipse will be drawn.

	See `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for details.

	An example circle:

	.. image:: images/drawcircle.png

``--draw[map]ellipse "<geometry> <color>"``
...........................................
	Draw an ellipse on the map. This is a synonym for ``--draw[map]circle``.

	See `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for details.

``--draw[map]line "<geometry> <color>"``
........................................
	Draw a line on the map, with the given geometry and color.

	See `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for details.

	An example line:

	.. image:: images/drawline.png

``--draw[map]arrow "<geometry> <color>"``
.........................................
	Draw an arrow on the map, with the given geometry and color.

	See `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for details.

	An example arrow:

	.. image:: images/drawarrow.png

``--draw[map]point "<x>,<y> <color>"``
......................................
	Draw a point on the map, at the given location, using the given color.

	See `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for details.

	An example point (red, in te white area):

	.. image:: images/drawpoint.png

``--draw[map]rectangle "<geometry> <color>"``
.............................................
	Draw a reactangle on the map, with the given geometry and color.

	See `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for details.

	An example rectangle:

	.. image:: images/drawrectangle.png


``--draw[map]text "<x>,<y> <color> <text>"``
............................................
	Write text on the map, at the specified location, using the given color.

	The text can consist of any number of words. Be careful when using
	characters that the command shell may interpret, like '``"``',
	'``$``', etc. On unix-like systems, use single quotes to avoid
	interpretation of most characters (except for ``'`` itself).

	Due to a limitation of the drawing library, currently only text that
	can be represented in (i.e. converted to) the ISO8859-2 character set is
	supported. Text that uses non-compatible characters will not be rendered
	correctly.

	Note that the combination of geometry, color and text should be a
	single argument.  This means that they must be enclosed in quotes
	together on the command-line, else they will be misinterpreted as three
	command-line arguments.

	Example::

		minetestmapper --drawtext "20,-10 red This text will be on the map"

	See also `--draw[map]<figure>`_ for more details.

	Example text:

	.. image:: images/drawtext.png

``--drawair``
.............
	Draw air nodes, as if they were regular nodes.

	This option is synonymous with `--drawnodes air`_.

``--drawalpha[=cumulative|cumulative-darken|average|none]``
...........................................................
	Specify how to render the transparency (defined by the alpha value) of nodes.

	    :none: don't render transparency. This is the same as
		    omitting this option.

	    :average: average the entire stack of transparent nodes
		    before combining the resulting color with the color of the
		    first opaque node below the stack. Water will remain transparent
		    indefinitely.

	    :cumulative: make lower nodes progressively more opaque.
		    The effect is for instance, that water becomes opaque below
		    a certain depth - only height differences will 'shine' through,
		    if shading is not disabled (`--noshading`_)

	    :cumulative-darken: Same as *cumulative*, except that
		    after the color has become opaque, it is progressively
		    darkened to visually simulate greater depth. This is looks great
		    for deeper waters that are not too deep.
		    The downside is that very deep water will eventually become black
		    when using this option.

	If this option is used without a method argument, the
	default is 'average'.

	For backward compatibility, 'nodarken' is still recognised as alias
	for 'cumulative'; 'darken' is still recognised as alias for
	'cumulative-darken'. They are otherwise undocumented. Please don't
	use them, they may disappear in the future.

	Note that each of the different modes has a different color definition
	for transparent blocks that looks best. For instance, for water, the following
	are suggested:

	    :(disabled):	``39 66 106`` [``192 224`` - optional: alpha value will be ignored]

	    :cumulative:	``78 132 255 64 224``

	    :cumulative-darken:	``78 132 255 64 224`` (same colors as cumulative)

	    :average:		``49 82 132 192 224`` (also looks good with alpha disabled)

	Custom colors files are provided for these alternatives: colors-average-alpha.txt
	and colors-cumulative-alpha.txt. If desired, these must be manually selected.

	The following images show average alpha mode, cumulative mode and cumulative-darken
	mode. In each case, the matching custom color file was selected:

	.. image:: images/alpha-average.png
	.. image:: images/alpha-cumulative.png
	.. image:: images/alpha-cumulative-darken.png


``--drawheightscale``
.....................
	If drawing a height map (`--heightmap`_), draw a height scale below the image.

	A height map with scale:

	.. image:: images/heightmap-scale.png

``--drawnodes [no-]air,[no-]ignore``
....................................
	Draw air-type or ignore-type nodes, as if they were regular nodes.
	By default they are not drawn.

	A prefix of '``no-``' inverts the effect, so that the nodes are ignored
	instead.

	Air-type nodes are the node named '``air``', and any node that has the
	`air` flag in the colors file.
	Ignore-type nodes are the node named '``ignore``', and any node that has the
	`ignore` flag in the colors file.
	See `Colors.txt Syntax`_.

	If a node has both the `air` flag and the `ignore` flag, the `ignore` flag
	takes precedence. I.e. the `air` flag will be ignored.

	If drawing `air` and/or `ignore` nodes, they must obviously have an entry
	in the colors file.

	WARNING 1:
	    The color of air-type and ignore-type nodes should most probably have an
	    alpha value of 0, so that they are fully transparent. The effect will be,
	    that they nodes are only visible if nothing else is below them.

	    Setting alpha to anything other than 0, will most probably cause
	    all non-air / non-ignore nodes to be obscured by all of the air/ignore
	    nodes that are above them.

	WARNING 2:
	    Drawing '``air``' or '``ignore``' nodes instead of ignoring them will have a
	    significant performance impact (unless they happen to be defined as opaque).
	    Use this with consideration.

	    Instead of enabling the drawing of '``air``' or '``ignore``' nodes, it may be
	    possible to achieve a similar result, with a negligible performance impact,
	    by using the option `--blockcolor`_.

	This option is the inverse of `--ignorenodes`_.

	Two images, one with air drawn, the other without. Look inside the rectangle:

	.. image:: images/background-white.png
	.. image:: images/drawair.png
	.. image:: images/drawair-detail-0.png
	.. image:: images/drawair-detail.png

``--draworigin``
................
	Draw a circle at the world origin (coordinates 0,0)

	The color can be set with `--origincolor`_.

	An image with world origin drawn:

	.. image:: images/draworigin.png

``--drawplayers``
.................
	Draw circles and player names at the positions of players

	The color can be set with `--origincolor`_.

	Just like for text drawn with `--draw[map]text`_, characters that cannot be converted
	to the ISO8859-2 character set will not be rendered correctly.

	An image with a few players:

	.. image:: images/players.png

``--drawscale[=left,top]``
..........................
	Draw scales at the left and/or top of the map.

	If neither 'left' nor 'top' is specified, draw them on both sides.

	The color of the lines and numbers can be set with `--scalecolor`_.

	The major and minor interval can be configured using
	`--sidescale-interval`_.

	Images of scales on the top, left and on both sides:

	.. image:: images/drawscale-left.png
	.. image:: images/drawscale-top.png
	.. image:: images/drawscale-both.png

``--geometry <geometry>``
.........................
	Specify the map geometry (i.e. which part of the world to draw).

	See `Geometry Syntax`_ for how the geometry can be specified.

	By default, the entire visible world is drawn.

``--geometrymode pixel,block,fixed,shrink``
...........................................
	Specify explicitly how the geometry should be interpreted.

	One or more of the flags may be used, separated by commas or
	spaces. In case of conflicts, the last flag takes precedence.

	See also `Geometry Syntax`_

	The geometry can have pixel or block granularity:

	    :pixel: Interpret the coordinates with pixel granularity.

		  A map of exactly the requested size is generated (after
		  adjustments due to the 'shrink' flag, or possible adjustments
		  required by the scale factor).

	    :block: Round the coordinates to a multiple of 16.

		  The requested geometry will be extended so that the map does
		  not contain partial map blocks (of 16x16 nodes each).
		  At *least* all pixels covered by the geometry will be in the
		  map, but there may be up to 15 more in every direction.

	The geometry can be fixed as requested, or the map can be shrunk:

	    :shrink: Generate a map of at most the requested geometry.
		  Shrink it to the smallest possible size that still includes the
		  same information.

		  Currently, shrinking is done with block granularity, and
		  based on which blocks are in the database. As the database
		  always contains a row or and column of empty, or partially
		  empty blocks at the map edges, there will still be empty
		  pixels at the edges of the map. Use `--blockcolor`_ to visualize
		  these empty blocks.

	    :fixed: Don't reduce the map size. What ever is specified
		  using a geometry option, is what will be drawn, even if partly
		  or fully empty.

		  **NOTE**: If this flag is used, and no actual geometry is
		  specified, this would result in a maximum-size map (65536
		  x 65536), which is currently not possible, and will fail,
		  due to a bug in the drawing library.

	The default is normally 'pixel' and 'fixed', if a geometry
	option was specified. See `Legacy Geometry Format`_ for one
	exception.

	Default image in the center, block mode enabled to the left and
	shrink mode enabled to the right:

	.. image:: images/geometrymode-block.png
	.. image:: images/geometrymode.png
	.. image:: images/geometrymode-shrink.png

``--heightmap-colors[=<file>]``
...............................
	Use the specified file as the heightmap colors file.

	See `Colors and Nodes Files`_ and `Heightmap-colors.txt Syntax`_.

	By default, minetestmapper will attempt to automatically find a
	suitable heightmap-colors.txt file. See `Colors Files Search Locations`_.

``--heightmap-nodes <file>``
............................
	Use the specified file as the heightmap nodes file.

	See `Colors and Nodes Files`_ and `Heightmap-nodes.txt Syntax`_.

	By default, Minetestmapper will attempt to automatically find a suitable
	heightmap-nodes.txt file. See `Colors Files Search Locations`_.

``--heightmap-yscale <factor>``
...............................
	Scale the heights of the map before computing the height map colors.

	This is useful when there are very large, or only very small, height
	differences in the world, and too much of the map is drawn in a
	single, or similar, colors.

	Using this option improves the spread of colors in the height map.
	The option `--height-level-0`_ may also be of use.

	'Factor' is a decimal number. A value of 1 means no change; a larger
	value stretches the color range, a smaller value (but larger than 0)
	condenses the color range.

	Note that the water level will probably not be rendered correctly for
	scale factors smaller than 1, nor for small non-integer scale factors.
	A suitable choice of ``--height-level-0`` may lessen this effect somewhat.

	For the same effect, a modified colors file could be used.
	``--heightmap-yscale`` is easier and quicker.

	Two images with a different y-scale:

	.. image:: images/heightmap-scale.png
	.. image:: images/heightmap-yscale.png

``--heightmap[=<color>]``
.........................
	Generate a height map instead of a regular map.

	If a color is given, a monochrome map is generated in shades of that
	color, ranging from black at depth -128 to the given color at height 127.

	See also `Color Syntax`_.

	Three colors are treated specially:

	    :white: The entire map will be white. Any visible structure will
		  result from the rendering of height differences.
	    :black: The entire map will be black. Any visible structure will
		  result from the rendering of height differences. This actually looks
		  pretty good
	    :grey: The map will be drawn in shades of grey, ranging from black
		  at level -128 to white at level 127

	If no color is specified, minetestmapper will use a colors file to
	determine which colors to use at which height level. See
	`Colors and Nodes Files`_ and `Heightmap-colors.txt Syntax`_.

	In any case, minetestmapper also needs a nodes file. See
	`Heightmap-nodes.txt Syntax`_ for details.

	A regular map, a greyscale height map and a colored height map:

	.. image:: images/scalefactor-2.png
	.. image:: images/heightmap-grey.png
	.. image:: images/heightmap-color.png

``--heightscale-interval <major>[,|:<minor>]``
...............................................
	When drawing a height scale at the bottom of the map, use the specified
	subdivisions.

	'major' specifies the interval for major marks, which are accompanied
	by a number indicating the height.

	When specified as 'major,minor', 'minor' specifies the interval for
	minor tick marks

	When specified as 'major:minor', 'minor' specifies the number of subdivisions
	of the major interval. In that case, major should be divisible by minor.
	E.g.: ``10:2`` is OK (equivalent to ``10,5``), ``10:3`` is not OK.

	By default, the major interval is calculated based on the available space
	and the range of heights in the map.
	The default minor interval is 0 (i.e. no minor ticks)

	The default height scale interval and a custom interval:

	.. image:: images/heightmap-scale.png
	.. image:: images/heightmap-scale-interval.png

``--height-level-0 <level>``
............................
	Specify the zero height level of the map to use for height maps.

	This is the world height that will be drawn using the color that the
	colors file specifies for level 0.
	This is useful when the average level of the world is lower
	or higher than the colors file caters for. It may also be of some use
	for height maps when the world has a non-standard sea level.

	The option `--heightmap-yscale`_ may also be of use if this option
	is used.

	For the same effect, a modified colors file could be used.
	``--height-level-0`` is easier and quicker.

``--help``
..........
	Print the option summary.

``--ignorenodes [no-]air,[no-]ignore``
......................................
	Ignore air-type or ignore-type nodes, so that they are not drawn at all.

	A prefix of '``no-``' inverts the effect, so that the nodes are drawn
	like regular nodes.

	This option is the inverse of `--drawnodes`_. E.g.::

	    --ignorenodes no-air,ignore

	is equivalent to::

	    --drawnodes air,no-ignore

	See `--drawnodes`_ for more information.

``--input <world_path>``
........................
	Specify the world to map.

	This option is mandatory.

``--max-y <y>``
...............
	Specify the upper height limit for the map

	Nodes higher than this level will not be drawn. This can be used
	to avoid floating islands or floating artefacts from obscuring the
	world below.

``--min-y <y>``
...............
	Specify the lower height limit for the map

	Any nodes below this level will not be drawn.

``--noshading``
...............
	Disable shading.

	Shading accentuates height differences by drawing artifical shade
	(i.e. making nodes lighter or darker depending on the height difference
	with adjacent nodes).

	A map with and without shading:

	.. image:: images/default-0.0.png
	.. image:: images/noshading.png

``--origincolor <color>``
.........................
	Specify the color to use for drawing the origin.

	An alpha value can be specified, but due to a bug in the
	drawing library, it will not have the desired effect.

	Use `--draworigin`_ to enable drawing the origin.

	See also `Color Syntax`_

``--output <output_image.png>``
...............................
	Specify the name of the image to be generated.

	This parameter is mandatory.

	Note that minetestmapper generates images in png format, regardless of
	the extension of this file.

``--playercolor <color>``
.........................
	Specify the color to use for drawing player locations

	An alpha value can be specified, but due to a bug in the
	drawing library, it will not have the desired effect for
	the circles.

	Use `--drawplayers`_ to enable drawing players.

	See also `Color Syntax`_

``--prescan-world=full|auto|disabled``
........................................
	Specify whether to prescan the world, i.e. whether to compute
	a list of which blocks inside the area to be mapped are actually
	in the database before mapping.

	When ``disabled``, minetestmapper will not compute such a list at
	all. While mapping, it will just attempt to load every possible
	block in the section of world determined by geometry and min-y and
	max-y.  This is synonymous with ``--disable-blocklist-prefetch``.
	See `--disable-blocklist-prefetch`_ for a discussion, caveats and
	other important notes.

	When set to ``full``, minetestmapper will always query the database
	for the complete list of blocks which exist in the entire world. Even
	if a smaller area could be queried for because of the map geometry,
	min-y or max-y.
	This allows the actual world dimensions to be reported, but at the
	cost of additional processing time, especially if the mapped part
	of the world is small compared to the existing world size.

	When set to the default value: ``auto``, if possible and sensible,
	minetestmapper will query the database for just a list of the blocks
	in the part of the world of interested, depending on geometry,
	min-y and max-y.  If it does, the actual world dimensions cannot
	be reported.

	Unfortunately, most database backends do not support querying for a
	partial block-list, or if they do, it is much less efficient than
	querying for a full list. Only the PostgreSQL backend supports it
	efficiently. So for all databases except PostgreSQL, ``auto`` is
	equivalent to ``full``.

``--progress``
..............
	Show a progress indicator while generating the map.

``--scalecolor <color>``
........................
	Specify the color to use for drawing the text and lines of the scales
	(both the side scales and the height map scale).

	Use `--drawscale`_ to enable drawing side scales.

	Use `--drawheightscale`_ to enable drawing the height scale.

	See also `Color Syntax`_

``--scalefactor 1:<n>``
.......................
	Generate the map in a reduced size.

	Basically, the image is be reduced in size while it is generated,
	by averaging a square region of pixels into one new pixel.

	This has several uses:

	* to generate overview maps of large worlds
	* if the image is otherwise too large to be practical
	* if the map image would be too large to be generated
	  (see `Known Problems`_).

	Another advantage of generating scaled maps directly, instead of using
	an external application, is that minetestmapper does not scale all
	parts of the image, just the world-area. The scales on the side for instance
	are not scaled, and neither is the thickness of lines (e.g. tile borders,
	figures, player names, etc.).

	The following scale factors are supported:

	    :1\:1: no scaling. This value has no effect.
	    :1\:2: reduce the map size by a factor 2
	    :1\:4: reduce the map size by a factor 4
	    :1\:8: reduce the map size by a factor 8
	    :1\:16: reduce the map size by a factor 16

	.. Note to readers of the text version: the factors above are
	.. slightly mangled due to markup. The non-markup scale factors
	.. are: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16.

	In addition, scaling needs to follow map block boundaries. That
	means that when scaling the map, regardless of the geometry,
	the same pixels will be averaged. E.g. if the scale factor is ``1:16``,
	then entire map blocks will be averaged, so therefore the map
	geometry can only include full map-blocks.

	If the requested geometry of the map is not suited to the
	requested scale factor, the map will be enlarged by as many nodes as
	needed.  The number of added nodes depends on the scale factor. E.g.
	if the scale factor is ``1:8``, then at most 7 nodes may be added to on
	each of the four sides of the map.

	Original map, and the same map, scaled to ``1:2`` and ``1:4``. The geometry is
	increased to keep the images the same size:

	.. image:: images/default-0.0.png
	.. image:: images/scalefactor-2.png
	.. image:: images/scalefactor-4.png

``--sidescale-interval <major>[,|:<minor>]``
.............................................
	When drawing a side scale at the top or left of the map, use the specified
	subdivisions.

	'major' specifies the interval for major marks, which are accompanied
	by a number indicating the coordinate.

	When specified as 'major,minor', 'minor' specifies the interval for
	minor tick marks

	When specified as 'major:minor', 'minor' specifies the number of subdivisions
	of the major interval. In that case, major should be divisible by minor.
	E.g.: ``100:20`` is OK (equivalent to ``100,5``), ``100:33`` is not OK.

	By default, the major interval is 64 for a ``1:1`` map, 128 for a ``1:2`` map etc.
	The default minor interval is 0 (i.e. no minor ticks)

	The default side scale interval, and a custom interval:

	.. image:: images/drawscale-both.png
	.. image:: images/sidescale-interval.png

``--silence-suggestions <types>``
......................................
	Do not print usage suggestions of the specified types.

	If applicable, minetestmapper may suggest using or adjusting certain options
	if that may be advantageous. This option disables such messages.

	    :all:		Silence all existing (and future) suggestions there may be.
	    :prefetch:		Do not make suggestions a about the use of `--disable-blocklist-prefetch`_,
				and adjustment of --min-y and --max-y when using --disable-blocklist-prefetch.
	    :sqlite3-lock:	Do not suggest using `--sqlite3-limit-prescan-query-size`_.

				This warning will be given if the database was kept locked for 1 second or
				more while fetching the block list `and` if the database was modified during
				that time.

``--sqlite-cacheworldrow``
..........................
	This option is no longer supported, as minetestmapper performed
	consistently worse with it than without it, as tested on a few
	large worlds.

	It is still recognised for compatibility with existing scripts,
	but it has no effect.

``--sqlite3-limit-prescan-query-size[=<blocks>]``
.................................................
	Limit the size of block list queries during a world prescan
	(see `--prescan-world`_).

	Use this if mapping while minetest is running causes minetest to
	report warnings like:

	    SQLite3 database has been locked for <duration>

	If minetestmapper locks the database for too long, minetest may even
	bail out eventually (i.e. crash).

	If `--sqlite3-limit-prescan-query-size` is used, instead of doing a single
	prescan query, minetestmapper will perform multiple queries, each for a
	limited number of blocks, thus limiting the duration of the database lock.

	To avoid blocks being skipped, which could happen if minetest has inserted new
	blocks into the database, every query will overlap with the previous query.

	Sample overlap sizes:

	    ============	==========	==========
	    Blocks		Overlap		Fraction
	    ============	==========	==========
	     2000		 1000		 50%
	     10000		 1000		 10%
	     100000		 10000		 10%
	     250000		 11750		 4.7%
	     1000000		 20000		 2%
	    ============	==========	==========

	The default value of `blocks` is 250000, the minimum value is 2000. The
	minimum overlap is 1000.

	E.g. with `blocks` = 100000 the overlap will be 10000, and minetestmapper will
	perform the following block list prescan queries:

	    =========		==========	==========
	    Query nr.		From		To
	    =========		==========	==========
	     1			 0		 110000
	     2			 100000		 210000
	     3			 200000		 310000
	     4			 300000		 410000
	    etc. etc.
	    =========		==========	==========

	When using small values of `blocks` on fast machines, while minetest is
	busy generating new parts of the world, the overlap may not be sufficient.
	It is recommended (and much more efficient) to use a value of at least
	100000.

``--tilebordercolor <color>``
.............................
	Specify the color to use for drawing tile borders.

	Use `--tiles`_ to enable drawing tiles.

	See also `Color Syntax`_

``--tilecenter <x>,<y>|world|map``
..................................
	Arrange the tiles so that one tile has, or would have, its center
	at map coordinates x,y.

	If the value 'world' is used, arrange for one tile to have its center
	at the center of the world instead. This is the default.

	If the value 'map' is used, arrange for one tile to have its center
	at the center of the map instead.

	(see also `--tileorigin`_)

``--tileorigin <x>,<y>|world|map``
..................................
	Arrange the tiles so that one tile has, or would have, its bottom-left
	(i.e. south-west) corner at map coordinates x,y.

	If the value 'world' is used, arrange for one tile to have its lower-left
	corner the origin of the world (0,0) instead.

	If the value 'map' is used, arrange for one tile to have its upper-left
	corner at map coordinate 0,0 (which is the upper-left pixel of the
	map-part of the image)

	(see also `--tilecenter`_)

``--tiles <tilesize>[+<border>]|block|chunk``
.............................................
	Divide the map in square tiles of the requested size. A border of the
	requested width (or width 1, of not specfied) is drawn between the tiles.
	In order to preserve all map pixels (to prevent overwriting them with
	borders), extra pixel rows and columns for the borders are inserted into
	the map.

	The special values 'block' and 'chunk' draw tiles that correspond to map
	blocks (16x16 nodes) or to chunks (the unit of map generation: 5x5 blocks
	for a world with default settings).

	In order to allow partial world maps to be combined into larger maps, tile
	borders at the edge of the map are always drawn on the same side (left or top).
	Other map edges are always border-less.

	NOTE: As a consequence of preserving all map pixels:

	* tiled maps (in particular slanted straight lines) may look slightly
	  skewed, due to the inserted borders.

	* scale markers never align with tile borders, as the borders are
	  logically *between* pixels, so they have no actual coordinates.

	* On scaled maps, only tile sizes and tile offsets that are a multiple
	  of the inverse scale (e.g. '8' for scale 1:8) are supported.

	See the options `--tileorigin`_ and `--tilecenter`_ for specifying the
	positioning of tiles. By default, tiles are arranged so that one tile
	has, or would have, its center at the world origin (0,0).

	Tiled maps. On the left, 16x16 tiles with corner at the world origin. In
	the middle, 16x16 tiles with center at the world origin. To the right,
	20x20 tiles with center at the world origin:

	.. image:: images/tiles-16.png
	.. image:: images/tiles-16-centered.png
	.. image:: images/tiles-20-centered.png


``--verbose-search-colors[=<n>]``
.................................

Color Syntax
============

    For a number of command-line parameters, a color argument is needed. Such
    colors are specified as follows:

Color Codes
-----------

    Colors can be specified using hexadecimal color codes::

	#[<alpha>]<red><green><blue>

    where every component is a hexadecimal (base 16) number between hexadecimal
    0 and ff (i.e. between 0 and 255).
    The components must all be 1 digit wide or all 2 digits wide.
    E.g.: ``#ff34c1``, ``#8123``

    The alpha component is optional in some cases, and not allowed in others. It
    defaults to opaque (``ff``).

    If the color components are specified using a single digit per color, that
    digit is duplicated to obtain the full value. E.g.:

	``#4c2`` --> ``#44cc22``

	``#8123`` --> ``#88112233``

Symbolic Colors
---------------

    In addition to the color codes, a few named colors are also available:

    :white:		``#ffffff``
    :black:		``#000000``
    :gray:		``#7f7f7f`` - (same as grey)
    :grey:		``#7f7f7f`` - (same as gray)
    :red:		``#ff0000``
    :green:		``#00ff00``
    :blue:		``#0000ff``
    :yellow:		``#ffff00``
    :magenta:		``#ff00ff`` - (same as fuchsia)
    :fuchsia:		``#ff00ff`` - (same as magenta)
    :cyan:		``#00ffff`` - (sama as aqua)
    :aqua:		``#00ffff`` - (sama as cyan)
    :orange:		``#ff7f00``
    :chartreuse:	``#7fff00``
    :pink:		``#ff007f``
    :violet:		``#7f00ff``
    :springgreen:	``#00ff7f``
    :azure:		``#007fff``
    :brown:		``#7f3f00``

Advanced usage: Lighter or Darker Colors
----------------------------------------

    As an additional feature, any color can lightened or darkened, or in general,
    be mixed with a basic color using the following syntax::

	<color>[+-][wkrgbcmy]<value>

    Where '+' mixes in, and '-' mixes out. one of the colors white (w), black (k), red (r), green (g), blue (b),
    cyan (c), magenta (m), yellow (y). The value specifies the amount, ranging from 0 (mix in/out no color) to
    1 (mix in/out as much of the color as possible). E.g.:

	``red+w0.25``: add 25% white: light red (``#ff3f3f``)

	``red+k0.50``: add 50% black: dark red (``#7f0000``)

	``red-w0.50``: remove 50% white: dark red as well (``#7f0000``)

	``white-b1``: remove 100% blue: yellow (``#ffff00``)

Geometry Syntax
===============

    For a number of options, like the 'geometry' options, but also
    the drawing options for instance, a geometry parameter must
    be specified. It can specify the dimensions in a few different
    ways:

    * As the corners of the area
    * As the lower-left corner, and the area's dimensions
    * As the center of the are, and the area's dimensions
    * As a corner and an angle and distance to the second corner
    * Using legacy format (compatible with standard minetestmapper)

    **Granularity**

    By default, the specified geometry has node granularity, in contrast
    with block (16x16) granularity.

    Using block granularity, all coordinates are rounded to the
    next multiple of 16. Node granularity keeps the sub-block
    coordinates as they are.

    Use `--geometrymode`_ if non-default behavior is desired.

    **Map Shrinking**

    By default, a map of exactly the requested size is generated
    (after any granularity adjustment, or adjustments that are
    required by scaling).

    Alternatively, the map size can be automatically reduced to
    remove empty blocks at its edges. This is the behavior of
    the standard version of minetestmapper.

    Use `--geometrymode`_ if non-default behavior is desired.

    **Coordinate Direction**

    The world coordinates 0,0 are the very center of the world. Coordinates
    decrease towards the lower-left (south-west) corner of the map,
    and they increase towards the upper-right (north-east) corner of the map.

    Note that this differs from the image coordinates, which are 0,0
    in the top-left corner of the map-part of the image, and increase towards
    the bottom-right.  Image coordinates in the left and top scale areas of
    the image are negative.

Geometry Using Two Corners
--------------------------

    A geometry using two corners of the area is specified as follows::

	<xcorner1>,<ycorner1>:<xcorner2>,<ycorner2>

    where ``xcorner1,ycorner1`` are the coordinates of
    one corner, and ``xcorner2,ycorner2`` are the coordinates
    of the opposite corner of the area.

    The coordinates are interpreted as inclusive: both
    the first and the second coordinate will be in the map.

    Example::

	--geometry -200,-100:200,200

Geometry Using Corner and Dimensions
------------------------------------

    A geometry using a corner of the area and its dimensions is
    specified as follows::

	<xoffset>,<yoffset>+<width>+<height>

    where ``xoffset,yoffset`` are the coordinates of the
    lower-left corner of the area, and ``width`` and ``height``
    are the dimensions of the map.

    Note that ``width`` and/or ``height`` can be negative, making
    ``xoffset,yoffset`` another corner of the image. For ease
    of using in scripting, the sign of a dimension does not need
    to replace the '+'. E.g. the following are valid and equivalent::

	--geometry -10,-10+11+11
	--geometry -10,10+11-11
	--geometry -10,10+11+-11
	--geometry 10,10-11+-11
	--geometry -10,-10:10,10

    The following alternate syntax is also supported::

	<width>x<height>[<+|-xoffset><+|-yoffset>]

    where ``xoffset,yoffset`` are the coordinates of the lower-left
    corner of the area. In this case, the offsets can be omitted,
    resulting in a map of the requested dimensions, centered at 0,0.

    Examples::

	--geometry 1000x1200
	--geometry 1000x1200-500+500

    **Compatibility**

    For backward compatibility, if the ``--centergeometry``
    option is used with a corner-style geometry, then that geometry is
    interpreted as a center geometry instead.

Geometry Using Center and Dimensions
------------------------------------

    A geometry using the center of the area and its dimensions
    is specified as follows::

	<xcenter>,<ycenter>:<width>x<height>

    where ``xcenter,ycenter`` are the coordinates of the center
    of the area, and ``width`` and ``height`` are its dimensions.

    Example::

	--geometry 100,100:300x150

    **Compatibility**

    For backward compatibility, if the ``--cornergeometry``
    option is used with a center-style geometry, then that geometry is
    interpreted as a corner geometry instead.

Geometry using Corner and Angle with Length
-------------------------------------------

    A geometry using one corner (or endpoint of the line) and an
    angle with a line length is specified as follows::

	--drawline <xcorner>,<ycorner>@<angle>+<length>[np]

    This syntax is only supported for 2-dimensional geometries
    (e.g. when drawing figures on the map).

    where ``xcorner,ycorner`` are the coordinates of one corner,
    ``angle`` is the angle, or compass direction, in degrees of the
    line or second corner, and ``length`` is the length of the
    line, or the distance to the second corner.

    An angle of 0° is north, 90° is east, 180° is south and 270° is
    west. Negative values are accepted as well: -90° is also west,
    for instance.

    When the map is scaled, the length may or may not need to be
    scaled. Where scaling is possible, a suffix 'n' specifies
    that the length is in nodes, and so it scales. A suffix 'p'
    specifies a length in pixels, which do not scale.

    Scaling is not possible for figures that are drawn on the map,
    e.g. using '--drawmapline'. Use '--drawline' instead if
    a figure must scale with the map.

    Example::

	--drawline 100,100@20+100p


Legacy Geometry Format
-----------------------

    The legacy format, compatible with standard version of
    minetestmapper is also still supported::

	<xoffset>:<yoffset>+<width>+<height>

    where ``xoffset,yoffset`` are the coordinates of the lower-left
    corner of the area, and ``width`` and ``height`` specify its
    dimensions.

    **Compatibility mode**

    This format has a compatibility mode with the standard version of
    minetestmapper.

    If the very first geometry option on the command-line is ``--geometry``,
    *and* uses this syntax, then block granularity and map shrinking
    are enabled, just like standard minetestmapper would. If this is not
    desired, then use a different geometry format, or use the option
    ``--geometrymode`` to change the behavior.

    Block granularity is also enabled when the obsolete (and otherwise
    undocumented) option ``--forcegeometry`` is found first on the command-line.

Advanced coordinate specification
---------------------------------

    Coordinates are normally specified as node coordinates. E.g.::

	--geometry -100,-100:100,100

    Minetestmapper also supports another way to specify coordinate values:
    specifying the minetest block number, and a node. Blocks are 16x16 nodes.
    There are two variants:

    The first variant specifies the block number, and a node within that block.
    The node must be a value between 0 and 15::

	<block>#<node>

    E.g.:


	``0#2``: node 2 in block 0, i.e. coordinate 2

	``1#2``: node 2 in block 1, i.e. coordinate 16+2 = 18

	``-10#6``: node 6 in block -10, i.e. coordinate -160+6 = -154

	``-3#11``: node 11 in block -3, i.e. coordinate -48+11 = -37

    The second variant specifies a block and a node offset in the
    same direction. I.e. for negative block numbers, the offset is
    in the negative direction as well::

	<block>.<offset>

    E.g.:

	``0.5``: the 5th node from block 0, i.e. coordinate 5

	``4.11``: the 11th node from block 4, i.e. coordinate 64+11 = 75

	``-0.1``: the 1st node in negative direction from block 0, i.e. coordinate -1

	``1.9``: the 9th node in positive direction from block 1, i.e. coordinate 16+9 = 25

	``-1.9``: the 9th node in negative direction from block -1, i.e. coordinate -16-9 = -25

	``-5.0``: the 0th node in negative direction from block -5, i.e. coordinate -80-0 = -80

Colors and Nodes Files
======================

    In order to know how to render a map, minetestmapper needs a colors and/or
    a nodes file. This section documents their format.

    * If a regular map is generated, a 'colors.txt' file is required.
    * If a height map is generated, a 'heightmap-nodes.txt' file is required, and
      optionally, a 'heightmap-colors.txt' file.

    All three types of files have some commonalities with respect to where minetest
    looks form them by default, and with respect to comments and file inclusion. These are
    documented in separate paragraphs below: `Colors Files Common Syntax`_,
    `Colors Files Search Locations`_

Colors.txt Syntax
-----------------

    The colors.txt file contains a list of minetest node names and associated
    colors. A minetest world node is converted to at most one pixel on the map,
    with a color as specified in the colors.txt file.

    Lines in the colors.txt file have the following syntax::

	<node-name> <red> <green> <blue> [<alpha> [<t>]] [flags]

    Where ``red``, ``green``, ``blue``, ``alpha`` and ``t`` are numbers from 0 to 255.

    Examples::

	default:apple 50 0 0
	default:sandstonebrick 160 144 108
	default:copperblock 110 86 60
	default:water_flowing 49 82 132 192 224

    **Alpha**

    If a node has an alpha (opacity) value *and* if the value is not 255,
    then it will be drawn transparently when `--drawalpha`_ is enabled. The effect
    is that the colors of nodes below it shine through.

    Water for instance, is defined as transparent. With transparency enabled,
    nodes under water will be visible, but they will acquire a more or
    less blueish color from the water. See `--drawalpha`_ for details about
    the different ways of computing transparency.

    if a node has an alpha of 0 (fully transparent), then it should normally
    never be visible on the map, regardless of its specified color. If there
    are any other (types of) nodes below it, then that is what will happen.
    If there are not, then that node *will* however be made visible. See
    the option `--drawair`_ for a use for this feature.

    **Flags**

    Nodes defined in the colors.txt file can have additional flags, which may
    allow them to be treated specially. Flags are specified as a comma-separated
    list without spaces. E.g.::

	example:flags_node	220 255 255	0	air,ignore

    Currently, two flags are defined:

    :air: The `air` flag causes the node to be treated like '``air``' nodes:
	by default, such nodes are ignored. The options `--drawair`_
	and `--drawnodes air`_ allow them to be drawn instead.

    :ignore: The `ignore` flag causes the node to be treated like '``ignore``' nodes:
	by default, such nodes are ignored. The option `--drawnodes ignore`_
	allows them to be drawn instead.

    Examples::

	# Default color for air
	air			220 220 255	0

	# Special air variants
	specialmod:air		220 220 255	0	air
	specialmod:red_air	255 220 220	0	air
	specialmod:green_air	220 255 220	0	air
	specialmod:blue_air	200 200 255	0	air

	# Nodes to be ignored altogether
	default:water_source	39 66 106	224	ignore
	default:water_flowing	39 66 106	224	ignore

    **Duplicate Entries**

    If the colors file contains duplicate entries for the same node, in general
    the later entry overrides the former.

    There is one exception to this rule: if one color is opaque (no alpha, or
    alpha = 255), and one is transparent (alpha < 255), the former will be selected when
    ``--drawalpha`` is disabled, and the latter will be selected when ``--drawalpha``
    is enabled::

	# Entry that will be used without 'drawalpha':
	default:water_source	39 66 106

	# Entry that will be used with 'drawalpha':
	default:water_source	78 132 212 64 224

    This is useful, as colors that look nice in a map without transparency
    don't always look nice in a map with transparency.

    **Default**

    A default colors.txt is included with minetestmapper, which includes
    the default nodes from minetest_game, as well as nodes from several
    popular mods.

    Two variants of the colors.txt are also included:

    ``colors-average-alpha.txt``:
	This version is recommended to be used in combination with
	``--drawalpha=average``

    ``colors-cumulative-alpha.txt``:
	This version is recommended to be used in combination with
	``--drawalpha=cumulative`` or ``--drawalpha=cumulative-darken``

Heightmap-nodes.txt Syntax
--------------------------

    The heightmap-nodes.txt file contains a list of minetest node names that
    are used to determine the ground height for a height map.

    The highest node of any of the types in this file determines the height at
    that point. Any nodes that should be ignored when determining the height,
    like obviously air, but probably also default:water_source, and
    default:grass_1, or default:torch, should not be in this file.

    As a general directive, plants, trees and any special nodes should not
    be included in the file. Stone, sand, gravel, minerals, etc. are the
    kinds of nodes that should be included. Normally, water nodes should
    probably not be included either.

    This file *can* have the same syntax as the colors.txt file, but the
    actual colors will be ignored. Alternatively, a simple list of node
    names also suffices::

	<node-name 1>
	<node-name 2>
	[...]

    Examples::

	default:sandstonebrick
	default:copperblock

    **Default**

    A default heightmap-nodes.txt is included with minetestmapper, and
    is searched for in the default locations. Alternatively, the file to use
    can be specified on the command line with ``--heightmap-nodes <file>``

Heightmap-colors.txt Syntax
---------------------------

    When generating a height map, either a single-color map can be
    generated, with colors ranging from black to one specific color,
    or a multi-color map can be generated.

    For a multi-color map, a heightmap-colors.txt is needed, which
    describes which colors to use. It has lines with the following syntax::

	<height 1>	<height 2>	<color 1>	<color 2>

    Where the heights are a number, or the special values ``-oo`` or ``oo`` (for
    negative and positive infinity).

    For example::

	-50	50	255 0 0		0 255 0
	50	100	0 255 0		0 0 255

    Which signifies that between height -50 to 50, the color of the nodes will
    slowly change from red to green, and between 50 and 100, the color will slowly
    change from green to blue.

    It is possible to specify overlapping ranges. The colors they specify will
    be averaged::

	-50	50	255 0 0		0 255 0
	-50	50	0 255 0		0 0 255

    Between the heights -50 and 50, the colors will change from ``#7f7f00`` to ``#007f7f``.
    (and *not* ``#ffff00`` to ``#00ffff``: the colors are *averaged*)

    **Default**

    A default heightmap-colors.txt is included with minetestmapper, and
    is searched for in the default locations. An attempt was made to make
    a standard minetest world look reasonably good, while at the same time
    providing colors for a large height range.

    A second file that is included, called heightmap-colors-rainbow.txt, defines rainbow
    colors instead.

    The file to use can also be specified on the command line with
    ``--heightmap-colors <file>``

Colors Files Common Syntax
--------------------------

    All three types of colors files (colors.txt, heightmap-nodes.txt and heightmap-colors.txt)
    have some syntax elements in common:

    * Any text starting from the first '#' on a line is considered a comment, and is ignored.
    * Any empty lines (afer ignoring comments), or lines containing only whitespace are ignored.

    In addition, a colors file may include another colors file using ``@include`` on a line. Any
    color definitions from the included file override earlier definitions; any color definitions
    after the inclusion point override the colors from the included file. For example in the
    following colors.txt file::

	# Defining default:stone here is useless, as the color from the system
	# colors file will override this.
	default:stone		71 68 67

	# Get all colors from the system colors file
	# (your system colors file may be located elsewhere!)
	@include /usr/share/minetestmapper/colors.txt

	# Use own color for default:dirt_with_grass, overriding the
	# one from the system file
	default:dirt_with_grass	82 117 54

    The colors.txt file also supports undefining colors (so that minetestmapper will complain
    about unknown nodes). This is achieved by specifying '-' instead of a color::

	# Get all colors from the system colors file
	# (your system colors file may be located elsewhere!)
	@include /usr/share/minetestmapper/colors.txt

	# Water is undefined. Minetestmapper will complain
	# that there are undefined nodes, and not draw water nodes.
	default:water_source	-
	default:water_flowing	-

	# A similar effect might be achieved by defining water
	# to have an alpha of 0. Minetest will not complain.
	#default:water_source	78 132 212 0
	#default:water_flowing	78 132 212 0

	# A different, more efficient, alternative may be to flag the
	# nodes as 'ignore-type' nodes. Minetest will not complain either.
	#default:water_source	78 132 212 225 ignore
	#default:water_flowing	78 132 212 225 ignore

Colors Files Search Locations
-----------------------------

    When minetestmapper needs a colors file (colors.txt, heightmap-nodes.txt and
    heightmap-colors.txt), it will search for it in a few predefined locations, which
    depend on the system it was built for, and the way minetestmapper was built.
    In general, the locations specified below can be searched (ordered from most preferred
    to least preferred):

    In order to find out exactly where a specific copy of minetestmapper did look
    for its files, use the option ``--verbose-search-colors=2``.

    * The file specified on the command line. If a colors file of the appropriate type
      was specified on the command-line, that file is used and no further locations
      are searched, even if the file does not exist, or cannot be found.

    * The directory of the world being mapped

    * The directory two levels up from the directory of the world being mapped
      (which would be the minetest configuration directory), provided that that directory
      contains a file 'minetest.conf'

    * The user's private minetest directory (``$HOME/.minetest``) - if the environment
      variable ``$HOME`` exists. (it would probably be called ``%HOME%`` on Windows).

.. NOTE:: on Windows, it would be more sensible to use ``%USERPROFILE%``, and search
	  another subdirectory than ``.minetest``. Please advise me about a suitable directory
	  to search - if at all (I am not a Windows user - I don't even own a copy of Windows...).
..

    * On Windows only: if minetestmapper can determine its own location, which is
      expected to have one of the following formats::

	<path-with-drive>\bin\minetestmapper.exe
	<path-with-drive>\minetestmapper.exe

      It searches the following directories:

      * The directory ``<path-with-drive>\colors\``

      * The directory ``<path-with-drive>\``

      I.e.: if the last directory is '``bin``' (or '``BIN``', etc.), then that part
      is removed from the path, and then the resulting path, with and without
      '``colors``' appended, is searched.

    * The system directory corresponding to the location where minetestmapper
      is installed. Usually, this would be ``/usr/share/games/minetestmapper/``
      or ``/usr/local/share/games/minetestmapper/``. This location was configured
      at *compile time*: moving minetestmapper around will not affect the search location.

    * For compatibility: in the current directory as a last resort.
      This causes a warning message to be printed.

Generating colors.txt files
---------------------------

While the colors.txt file provided with minetestmapper contains color definitions for a
large number of nodes of different popular mods, it is not, and cannot ever be complete.

For users on linux and unix(-like) systems (probably including OSX), a few scripts are
provided to aid in the creation of a colors.txt file based on the actual mods the user
is using. Unfortunately, these scripts are still a bit unpolished. They may run without
any problem, and they may generate a perfect colors.txt file on first run. However, it
may also require some effort to get them to produce a good colors.txt file, and the
resulting file may very well need some manual modifications of some colors to make them
look better.

Please consult `<../dumpnodes/README.dumpnodes>`_ for more information on how to use
the scripts.

The scripts are not supported on Windows. While it is probably possible to get them
to work, be prepared to do some research on the subject of getting bash scripts to run
on windows, and be prepared to invest some time... Alternatively, be prepared to
rewrite at least the bash script in another scripting language.
